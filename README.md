# Courses Platform E-learning App (Freelance Project - In Progress)
The Courses Platform is an educational web application currently under development as a freelance project, designed to offer courses in various programming fields. It provides a seamless learning experience with several interactive features. The front-end is ready, and I am currently waiting for the backend to be completed for integration. Key features include:
- User Authentication: Users can create accounts, log in, reset passwords, and update their profiles.
- Online Course Purchase: Users can easily purchase courses through secure online payment methods.
- Course Rating and Reviews: After completing a course, users can rate it and provide feedback to help other learners.
- Instructor Interaction: If a user doesn't understand a part of the course, they can submit a query, and an instructor will join a discussion with them for clarification.
- Progress Tracking: Users can track their learning progress, revisit materials, and mark lessons as complete.
- Certificate of Completion: Upon finishing a course, users will receive a digital certificate to showcase their skills.
- Discussion Forums: Each course includes a discussion board where users can ask questions, share insights, and interact with fellow learners.
- Quizzes and Assignments: Courses feature quizzes and practical assignments to reinforce learning and assess progress.
- Responsive Design: The platform is optimized for all screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.
